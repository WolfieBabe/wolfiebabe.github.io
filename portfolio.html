      <h1 id="CYOA">Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

      <p>This project was the second I completed for the 2023 GWC (Girls Who Code) SIP (Summer Immersion Program) sponsored by Moody's Corporation wherein I created a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) game. The game consisted of three different endings with varying choices along the way; it is fantastical in nature, with an exciting foray out of normal life.</p>

      <h1 id="interactiveAvatar">Interactive Avatar</h1>

      <p>This project was the first I worked on for the 2023 GWC (Girls Who Code) SIP (Summer Immersion Program) sponsored by Moody's Corporation. We were tasked with making our own interactive avatars that blink when clicked. Using the p5play library I coded directional blinking and smiling.</p>

      <h1 id="dojaOrLizzo">Are You More of a Doja Cat or a Lizzo?</h1>

      <p>This is the 2nd project I completed at the Girls Who Code SIP. It was a bare-bones personality quiz based on the question of whether the user was more like Doja Cat or Lizzo. Its main goal was to incorporate javascript into a website successfully.</p>

      <h1 id="protectTransRights">Protect Trans Rights</h1>

      <p>This was my final project of the Girls Who Code SIP, the activist toolkit. It combined all of the previous lessons: HTML, CSS, and JS. It serves as a rudimentary introduction to campaigning for transgender rights. The website features a basic Home page; a resources page with an embedded twitter feed to <a href="https://twitter.com/tracktransbills?lang=en">@TrackTransBills</a> and a custom message generator as well as a small "about" page.</p>

      <h1 id="semesterGenerator">Semester Grade and GPA Generator</h1>

      <p>I started working on this project on May 9, 2022, and completed the first version of it 20 days later. Over the days following, I added the "GPA Generator" function and organized it with formatting. I then developed a few betas and completed the project on August 19th. This project includes an interactive final grade and weighted/unweighted generator. It also includes a minimum final grade needed for a specific grade and a color-coded chart showing which subject you should focus on studying. <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h3J6IDpTuWBFxKkQW2EH-_0YghuhZyDD12h8Xm_t5PQ/copy>Link to copy the spreadsheet</a></p>

      <h1 id="EDDFinal">Engineering Design & Development Final: The EasyGlide Razor</h1>

      <p>This project was my semester-long Engineering Design & Development Final: The EasyGlide Razor. Throughout these months, I strategized, collected data, and developed an improved razor design with a lubrication projection system. This project included the most comprhensive survey and analysis that I have conducted to date. Following this survey I researched patents and other designs; moreover, I recognized the importance of researching other designs and patents, properly citing the sources in a proper APA "References" page. Through the use of CAD programs such as Autodesk Inventor and 3D printing I finalized this product. Finally, I presented the below presentation documenting my progress to a panel of three engineers and the local community.</p>
