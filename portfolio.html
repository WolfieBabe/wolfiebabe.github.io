      <h1 id="CYOA">Choose Your Own Adventure</h1>

      <p>This project was the second I completed for the 2023 GWC (Girls Who Code) SIP (Summer Immersion Program) sponsored by Moody's Corporation wherein I created a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) game. The game consisted of three different endings with varying choices along the way; it is fantastical in nature, with an exciting foray out of normal life.</p>

      <p>This project was the first I worked on for the 2023 GWC (Girls Who Code) SIP (Summer Immersion Program) sponsored by Moody's Corporation. We were tasked with making our own interactive avatars that blink when clicked. Using the p5play library I coded directional blinking and smiling.</p>

      <p>This is the 2nd project I completed at the Girls Who Code SIP. It was a bare-bones personality quiz based on the question of whether the user was more like Doja Cat or Lizzo. Its main goal was to incorporate javascript into a website successfully.</p>

      <h1 id="protectTransRights">Capstone Portfolio: Political, Social, and Environmental Responsibility - Protect Trans Rights</h1>

      <p>This was my final project of the Girls Who Code SIP, the activist toolkit. It combined all of the previous lessons: HTML, CSS, and JS. It serves as a rudimentary introduction to campaigning for transgender rights. The website features a basic Home page; a resources page with an embedded twitter feed to <a href="https://twitter.com/tracktransbills?lang=en">@TrackTransBills</a> and a custom message generator as well as a small "about" page. Knowing the injustices minority groups, such as transgender people, face in today's climate, I feel that is one's duty to educate themselves and excersice their privalege and voice to help by sociopolitical means. Without doing so, these groups will be subjected to more violence and opression than they already experience.</p>

      <p>This project was my semester-long Engineering Design & Development Final: The EasyGlide Razor. Throughout these months, I strategized, collected data, and developed an improved razor design with a lubrication projection system. This project included the most comprhensive survey and analysis that I have conducted to date. Following this survey I researched patents and other designs; moreover, I recognized the importance of researching other designs and patents, properly citing the sources in a proper APA "References" page. Through the use of CAD programs such as Autodesk Inventor and 3D printing I finalized this product. Lastly, I presented the below presentation documenting my progress to a panel of three engineers and the local community.</p>

      <h1 id="ethicsDoc">Capstone Portfolio: Ethical and Responsible Behaviors  -  Spectacles of Suffering: The Hypocrisy of Martyrdom in Kafka’s A Hunger Artist</h1>

      <p>The doc you see below was a paper that  I wrote for my Introduction to Literature class. In this paper I recognized and dissected the the hypocritical nature of society through Franz Kafka's lens, particularly focusing on the religious aspects therein. Furthermore, I argued that by commodifing suffering, society strips it of its spiritual, moral, and ethical value. I showed how, through the use of religious symbolism and metaphorical contrast, Kafka exposes how institutions ethically fail by exploiting suffering for control, status, or entertainment. Consequently, this speaks to a wider issue of the authenticity, integrity, and moral cost of performative martyrdom.</p>

      <h1 id="diversityDoc">Capstone Portfolio: Diversity Awareness  -  Caricature and How It Relates to All: An Analysis of Driving Miss Daisy by Alfred Uhry</h1>

      <p>The essay below is another paper I wrote for my Introduction to Literature class. In my critique of Driving Miss Daisy I demonstrated that Alfred Uhry illustrates how institutionalized racism and classism did not simply vanish in the past but exist in a more subtle presence today. Through the analysis of internalized prejudice in Daisy and assertion of dignity in Hoke, I emphasized the necessity of introspection and self-awareness as to the nature of our own unconscious prejudice. Additionally, I demonstrated that the metamorphosis of solidarity by the marginalized groups, as reflected in Uhry, is a reminder that we need the active confrontation of discrimination, the responsible handling of privilege to evolve. Today, it invites us to construct sincere cross-community allyship, promote equity in day to day dealings, and be on full alert against the re-disguising of systematic oppression.</p>

      <h1 id="semesterGenerator">Semester Grade and GPA Generator</h1>

      <p>I started working on this project on May 9, 2022, and completed the first version of it 20 days later. Over the days following, I added the "GPA Generator" function and organized it with formatting. I then developed a few betas and completed the project on August 19th. This project includes an interactive final grade and weighted/unweighted generator. It also includes a minimum final grade needed for a specific grade and a color-coded chart showing which subject you should focus on studying. <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h3J6IDpTuWBFxKkQW2EH-_0YghuhZyDD12h8Xm_t5PQ/copy>Link to copy the spreadsheet</a></p>
